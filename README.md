Install it at [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/original-toots-only/jmkgmhecpnacpoilpekodceagbidllnj).

## Why do I need this
Some people like to interact with people that post original content. Currently Mastodon doesn't have official feature to let people do that on backend, thus this hacky way to filter on frontend.

## How to use
1. Install this extension from [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/original-toots-only/jmkgmhecpnacpoilpekodceagbidllnj) or "load unpacked" this folder on your chrome extension management page.
2. Navigate to your mastodon timeline or a user's profile page on their instance(whose URL should look like "instance domain/@username", for example, "douchi.space/@mtfront").
3. Click the extension icon to open this tool.
4. Click "Hide/Show" button to hide or show user's retoot.
5. You may need to manually load older content (click "show older" at bottom of the page if you're on someone's profile) then click this button, if user has a lot of retoots and take up their first few pages.
